# Stock Price Movement Prediction Using FFNN CNN RNN

This project aims to predict the movement of future trading price of Netflix (NFLX) stock using transaction data on January 3, 2017 from the Limit Order Book (LOB). Stationary features were created to overcome autocorrelation and reduce noises of the time series data. For this project, a random forest model was built as baseline and three types of neural network models were develpted and compared: Feed Forward Neural Networks (FFNN), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN).
